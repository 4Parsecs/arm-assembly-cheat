# Compilers

Mentioned on website:

<https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/compilers>

LLVM gets most attention.

## Keil

The in-house compiler.

Yet another company bought by ARM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keil_(company)>, in 2005.

### Keil MDK

Microcontroller development kit.

IDE. 2013 Demo: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pgw7-WnsBMs>

### DS-5

<https://developer.arm.com/products/software-development-tools/ds-5-development-studio>

Another IDE. TODO vs MDK.

## ARM Compiler 5

In-house.

Uses the axf object format: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17761328/what-are-axf-files>

Older compiler, more stable, less features.

## ARM Compiler 6

LLVM based. TODO not free? But how is Android moving to it then?

In 2014 there was a source opening: <http://www.embedded.com/electronics-blogs/cole-bin/4429846/ARM-follows-Apple-to-the-open-source-LLVM-compiler->

## GCC

No professional support.

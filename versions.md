<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ARM_microarchitectures> has a good breakdown, and shows the hierarchy:

- family
- architecture
- core

<http://www.davespace.co.uk/arm/introduction-to-arm/arm-arch123.html> and following chapters have a good summary of the evolution of the architecture.

## Cortex

Family name of the most recent CPUs.

There are three subdivisions for different markets: A, R and M.

Does a good job from removing the confusing `ARMX` family branding, which looks too similar to the `ARMvX` architecture names.


### Cortex A

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A

Has MMU.

### Cortex R

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-R

Real time use.

### Cortex M

Low power.

The least powerful line: <http://www.design-reuse.com/articles/26106/cortex-r-versus-cortex-m.html>

## ARMv7

Added floating point operations.
